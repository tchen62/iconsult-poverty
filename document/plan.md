## First Stage  

Getting familiar with the data we have.  
Each teammates have to look at at least one aspect of all the tables and make documents about what discovery the person have. 


## Tools  
There are many useful tool we can use for this project, but we care about reproducability.  We need to use tools that anyone can reproduce our work, which means tools like Microsoft Excel and SPSS should not be considered.  
We highly recommend R and Python.
