## **iConsult Collaborative**     

**Build your real-world experience in Digital Transformation!**   

The iConsult Collaborative is a university-wide program to build experience for students through real-world client projects involving digital transformation.  Student participants in iConsult form project teams representing needed specialty domains of the schools and colleges of the University.  Each iConsult team works under the direction of faculty mentors and a student Project Leader who oversees the client relationship and the team’s deliverables.  iConsult Project teams analyze, design, recommend, and apply known information tools and approaches to help clients integrate digital technology into their organizations.

**The Background of the iConsult Collaborative**

iConsult was developed originally under a Kauffman Foundation grant by iSchool faculty member David Dischiave in 2008.  In the Fall of 2009, iConsult consisted of 7 local projects, engaging 9 students.  The program was expanded in 2012 under the direction of iSchool faculty member Art Thomas.  During the 2017-18 academic year, the program engaged 80 students who gained about 10,000 hours of experience while working on more than 30 client projects.

**Today’s iConsult Story**

In 2018, iConsult was revised and expanded into a University-wide program in collaboration with both corporate and community engagement partners and sponsors.  This gives the opportunity to involve students from multiple schools and colleges within the University in cross-functional teams.  The iConsult Collaborative, as it is now known, builds upon its long-term foundation to work on a broad range of projects leading toward the digital transformation of its clients in several business sectors.  

The iSchool directs and manages the iConsult Collaborative on behalf of the University.
